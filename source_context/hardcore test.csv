Speaker,Dialogue
Harry,Blimey Hermione are you sure about this? It feels… wrong.
Hermione,Harry we've been over this a hundred times. The incantation is 'Portus' a simple charm for creating a Portkey. It's perfectly safe in controlled conditions like these.
Ron,Safe for you maybe. Remember when Fred and George turned that old toilet seat into a Portkey? Ended up in the middle of the Forbidden Forest surrounded by Acromantulas. Not exactly a picnic.
Hermione,Ronald that was different. They used a faulty incantation and didn't calibrate the destination properly. I've double-checked everything. This Portkey will take us directly to Dumbledore's office. No detours no Acromantulas.
Harry,Right then. 'Portus' you say?
Hermione,Yes and point your wand at the object you want to enchant. In this case this old Snitch.
Harry,Okay… Portus!
Ron,Nothing's happening.
Hermione,Wait for it. It takes a moment for the enchantment to take hold.
Narrator,The Snitch begins to glow with a faint blue light.
Ron,Whoa it's glowing!
Hermione,That's it. Now anyone who touches it will be transported.
Harry,So we just grab it?
Hermione,Yes but all at the same time. Otherwise you'll arrive separately.
Ron,Right then. One two three!
Narrator,They all reach out and touch the Snitch.
Harry,Whoa I feel a… pulling sensation.
Ron,Me too. Like my stomach's being left behind.
Hermione,It's the Portkey transporting us. Just hold on tight.
Narrator,The room around them begins to spin and blur.
Harry,This is worse than a Floo Network journey!
Ron,I think I'm going to be sick.
Hermione,Just breathe Ronald. We'll be there in a moment.
Narrator,The spinning stops abruptly and they find themselves standing in Dumbledore's office.
Harry,Ugh. I feel a bit dizzy.
Ron,Tell me about it. I think I left my insides somewhere over the Transfiguration classroom.
Hermione,Well we're here. That's the important thing. Now let's tell Professor Dumbledore about the suspicious activity we witnessed near the Room of Requirement.
